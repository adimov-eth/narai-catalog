        <p>
        💡 Ever wondered how the price of Stars is determined? Let's break down the Automated Market Maker (AMM) system in TON Stars!<br><br>

        🤔 What is AMM?<br>
        It's a smart contract that automatically sets prices based on supply and demand.<br><br>

        🔄 How it works in TON Stars:<br>
        1. You trade Quarks for Stars (or vice versa)<br>
        2. The AMM adjusts prices to maintain balance<br>
        3. Early adopters benefit from lower initial prices<br><br>

        🧮 The math behind it:<br>
        We use the formula x * y = k<br>
        Where x = Quark supply, y = Star supply, and k = constant<br><br>

        A) Price goes up<br>
        B) Price goes down<br>
        C) Price stays the same<br><br>
